# ExcelToJson
This is my first TRY on Github. :) 

There is an excel file "ViewExcel.xlsx" which recodes Chinese cities text , cities ID and cities type.

Now I need a Json format of this Excel, and the Json result should be group by the first char of Chinese phonetic alphabet which is named "Pin-Yin".

Referenced ChnCharInfo.dll , that simplified Chinese Pin-Yin Conversion Library provides a Set of  APIs that  extract Simplified Chinese Character properties, such as sounds, homophone and polyphone.

Thank you for you reading.
Please tell me any bug you find.
